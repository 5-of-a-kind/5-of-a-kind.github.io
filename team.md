Hi I am Joe Richards 20 years old and am studying Computer Science at UCLan.<br/>
In my free time I tend to play video games on my PS4 and PC . The main game I am playing at the moment is Spider-Man which I'm aiming for that sweet 100%.<br/>
I live about a 20 minute car ride away from Preston and have lived there since when I was a child.<br/>
