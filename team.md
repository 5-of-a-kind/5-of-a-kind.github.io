Hi I am Joe 20 years old and am studying Computer Science at UCLan.<br/>
In my free time I tend to play video games on my PS4 and PC. The main game I am playing at the moment is Spider-Man which I'm aiming for that sweet 100%.<br/>
I live about a 20 minute car ride away from Preston and have lived there since when I was a child.<br/>
I also have two cats, one called Scully who is sat on my lap in the picture and the other Mulder who are both about 7 years old.

### Carly Jones

Hey, I’m Carly! I’m 31 years old and studying Cyber Security at UCLan. I was born in the UK but lived in Canada for 20 years, so I constantly get asked about my accent. <br/> I returned to England in 2015 and now live in Preston with my husband and my younger sister, who is also a UCLan student. In my free time I like to read, write, take our two border collies on walks, play videogames (PC and Playstation), and bake cakes.
